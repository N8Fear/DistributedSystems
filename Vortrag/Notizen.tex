Application: disseminating data in large-scale distributed systems; data aggregation, overlay maintenance, resource allocation

repeated probabilistic(key element)  exchange of information between two members 

important: probabilitic, repetition, relates to spreading epidemics

info can spread quickly, is persistent, good if membership andn/or relation in group changes

gossiping solutions are often indifferent of changes in the group while exhibiting convergent behaviour

Fig 1: general organization

2 threads, one active(initiative, sends), one passive (accepting incoming requests9
each peer has a cache for storing peer specific information


================================00
Peer selection: wired: assumption: selection works uniformly on the whole set of peers
wireless: selection considers neighbours in range
(in both cases not strict, wireless can emulate wired connections)

synchronous/asynchronous

data exchange: peers decide individually, instead of data "peerlists" can be exchanged

data processing: highly application dependant
==================================00

gossiping is fast, generally O(log N) rounds to reach all nodes, may introduce much redundancy

possibility of combining multicast and gossiping to get probabilitic reliable mulsticasting

CREW system: info partitioned into chunks, list of chunks is broadcasted to all peers, each node pulls missing chunks from random peers
--> downside: possible flooding (especially on nodes wit hhigh indegree), therefore reduce variance of indegree distribution

3 main results: (1) simple, (2) scalable, (3) probabilistic guarantees of message delivery

Peer sampling:

gossip based membership algorithms: Lpbcast, Newscast, CYCLON

scalable peer sampling service


topology construction:

each node maintains partial view -> result: overlay network
connections are associated with a weight to get some kind of structure

resource management:

centralized approach creates bottlenecK - gossiping can be used to decentralize 

Computations:

efficient to compute aggregates (sum, averages, max or min)
